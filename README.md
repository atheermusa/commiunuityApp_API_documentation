# commiunuityApp_API_documentation
We are building a neighbourhood collaboration site and we want to make a system to keep track of people, houses, and addresses of those houses.
   - Each person has a name, age and number of people in their household
   - Each house has an address and an owner
   - Each address has a postcode and street address

The REST API will need to enable users to:
   - Store people, houses and addresses
   - Look up a house, itâ€™s address and owner
   - Look up people in our neighbourhood within certain age brackets and with specific household sizes
